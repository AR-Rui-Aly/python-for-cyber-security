Write a Python program that takes three input values representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The program should classify the triangle as one of the following types:

Equilateral: All sides are of equal length.
Isosceles: Exactly two sides are of equal length.
Scalene: No sides are of equal length.
Not a Triangle: The given side lengths cannot form a triangle.
